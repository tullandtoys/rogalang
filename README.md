# rogalang

Every line must start with "jille"
Lines without "jille" are comments

At least every ten lines, the keyword "Herliga London" must appear, for performance reasons.

Here at tullandtoys programming we believe that programming shouldn't be a chore; it should be an artform. Therefore, the first line has to be 'herliga london' (case insensitive of course ;))

Rogaland is a camelCase language. To ensure this, you can never use the symbol "_" at any point.

## Roadmap
 - There should be a way to check that herliga london placement is not predictable so that programming in Rogalang never turns boring

 ## TODO
 - Replace weird string replacement with string split
